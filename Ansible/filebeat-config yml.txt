#============================= Elastic Cloud ==================================

# These settings simplify using Filebeat with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).

# The cloud.id setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.hosts` and
# `setup.kibana.host` options.
# You can find the `cloud.id` in the Elastic Cloud web UI.
#cloud.id:

# The cloud.auth setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.username` and
# `output.elasticsearch.password` settings. The format is `<user>:<pass>`.

#================================ HTTP Endpoint ======================================
# Each beat can expose internal metrics through a HTTP endpoint. For security
# reasons the endpoint is disabled by default. This feature is currently experimental.
# Stats can be access through http://localhost:5066/stats . For pretty JSON output
# append ?pretty to the URL.

# Defines if the HTTP endpoint is enabled.
#http.enabled: false

# The HTTP endpoint will bind to this hostname, IP address, unix socket or named pipe.
# When using IP addresses, it is recommended to only use localhost.
#http.host: localhost

# Port on which the HTTP endpoint will bind. Default is 5066.
#http.port: 5066

# Define which user should be owning the named pipe.
#http.named_pipe.user:

# Define which the permissions that should be applied to the named pipe, use the Security
# Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) to define the permission. This option cannot be used with
# `http.user`.

# If enabled, Filebeat periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed

  # Intervals must be at least 1s. Values of 1m, 1h, 24h, 7*24h, 30*24h, and 365*24h
  # are boundary-aligned with minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years as
